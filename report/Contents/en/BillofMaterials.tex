\subsubsection{TensorFlow}

TensorFlow is Google's open-source machine learning library, initially developed internally at Google and released to the public in 2015. It has since gained a substantial external community of contributors and is compatible with Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms. TensorFlow is the primary machine learning library used within Google, and its core code is consistent across both internal and public versions. While it provides a wide array of tools and optimizations for training and deploying models in the cloud, it was originally designed with a focus on desktop environments, prioritizing lower latency and added functionality, which might not be ideal for platforms with limited resources like Android and iPhone devices, where even a few megabytes added to an app's size can significantly impact downloads and user satisfaction. Building TensorFlow for these platforms typically increases the application size, and despite efforts, it remains relatively large, usually not shrinking below 2 MB even with optimization \cite{Warden:2019}.

\textbf{Installation Procedure}

The official TensorFlow Lite Micro library for Arduino is available in the tflite-micro-arduino-examples GitHub repository. To install the latest in-development version of this library, you can directly use the GitHub repository. This involves cloning the repository into the folder that contains libraries for the Arduino IDE. The location of this folder may vary by operating system, typically residing in \texttt{\textasciitilde/Arduino/libraries} on Linux, \texttt{\textasciitilde/Documents/Arduino/libraries/} on MacOS, and \texttt{My Documents\textbackslash Arduino\textbackslash Libraries} on Windows.

Once you are in that folder in the terminal, you can obtain the code using the \texttt{git} command line tool:

\begin{verbatim}
	git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro-arduino-examples Arduino_TensorFlowLite
\end{verbatim}

To update your cloned repository with the latest code, use the following terminal commands:

\begin{verbatim}

\section{\href{run:../Code/KeywordSpotting/envRequirements/requirements.txt}{\texttt{requirements.txt}}}
\label{section:requirementsFile}

Utilizing Python requirements files is an effective method for managing Python modules. These files are straightforward text documents that store a compilation of the modules and packages essential for your project. By generating a requirements.txt file, you can effortlessly identify and install all the necessary modules manually.


\subsubsection{Benefits of Using \texttt{requirements.txt}:}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Facilitates comprehensive tracking of Python modules and packages incorporated into your project.
	\item Streamlines the installation process of all required modules on any computer, eliminating the need for manual searches through online documentation or Python package repositories.
	\item Enables the seamless installation of dependencies on different computers, ensuring compatibility among them.
	\item Simplifies project sharing by allowing others to effortlessly install the specified Python modules listed in your \texttt{requirements.txt} file, enabling smooth project execution without complications.
	\item Offers a straightforward method for updating or adding Python modules to your project by simply modifying the \texttt{requirements.txt} file, eliminating the need to scour through your code for every reference to the outdated module.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Creating a \texttt{requirements.txt} File:}

Begin by navigating to your Python project directory and creating a new \texttt{.txt} document. Ensure it is named \texttt{requirements.txt} and save it in the same directory as your \texttt{.py} files for the project. At this point, there isn't much more to be done for creating a Python requirements file. However, we will delve into the manual installation of specific packages in the terminal.

Alternatively, you can generate a \texttt{requirements.txt} file directly from the command line using the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
	pip freeze > requirements.txt
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{pip freeze} command outputs a list of all installed Python modules along with their respective versions.

\subsubsection{Adding Modules to Your \texttt{requirements.txt} File:}

The initial step involves opening the text document and inserting the names of the modules you intend to install. For instance, if you wish to incorporate the TensorFlow library into your project, type "tensorflow" on a new line along with the desired version. Consider the following example for your \texttt{requirements.txt} file:

\begin{verbatim}
	tensorflow==2.3.1
	uvicorn==0.12.2
	fastapi==0.63.0
\end{verbatim}

After including all the required modules, save the document.

\subsection{Installing Python Packages from a \texttt{requirements.txt} File}

\subsubsection{Utilizing the Package Manager Pip:}

To install packages from it, we will utilize the package manager \texttt{pip}. \texttt{Pip} is a versatile utility employed for the installation, upgrade, and uninstallation of Python packages. Additionally, it plays a role in managing Python virtual environments and more.

\subsubsection{Installing Python Packages from a \texttt{requirements.txt} File:}

To initiate \texttt{pip}, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your Python project directory. Once there, enter the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
	pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{verbatim}

This command installs all the modules specified in your Python requirements file into the project environment.

\textbf{Output:}

\begin{verbatim}
	Successfully installed absl-py-1.0.0 astunparse-1.6.3 ...
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Note:}
It is advisable to set up a new environment before installing packages with your Python requirements file. If you need to remove a module, use the same command but replace "install" with "uninstall." Similarly, use "upgrade" instead of "install" to update previously installed Python packages. As mentioned earlier, employ the command \texttt{pip freeze} to generate a list of the Python modules installed in your environment.


\subsection{Maintaining a Python Requirements File}

\textbf{Step 1:} Output a list of outdated packages with \texttt{pip list --outdated}.

\textit{Output:}

\begin{verbatim}
	Package             Version  Latest  Type
	click               7.1.2    8.0.3   wheel
	fastapi             0.63.0   0.70.0  wheel
	gast                0.3.3    0.5.3   wheel
	h5py                2.10.0   3.6.0   wheel
	numpy               1.18.5   1.21.4  wheel
	pip                 20.0.2   21.3.1  wheel
	setuptools          44.0.0   59.5.0  wheel
	starlette           0.13.6   0.17.1  wheel
	tensorflow          2.3.1    2.7.0   wheel
	tensorflow-estimator 2.3.0    2.7.0   wheel
	uvicorn             0.12.2   0.15.0  wheel
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Step 2:} Upgrade the required package with \texttt{pip install -U PackageName}. For example, updating \texttt{fastapi}:

\begin{verbatim}
	pip install -U fastapi
\end{verbatim}

\textit{Output:}

\begin{verbatim}
	Successfully installed anyio-3.4.0 fastapi-0.70.0 sniffio-1.2.0 starlette-0.16.0
\end{verbatim}

It is also possible to upgrade everything:

\begin{verbatim}
	pip install -U -r requirements.txt
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Step 3:} Check to see if all tests pass.

\textbf{Step 4:} Run \texttt{pip freeze > requirements.txt} to update the Python requirements file.

\textbf{Step 5:} Run \texttt{git commit} and \texttt{git push} to the production branch.

Freezing all dependencies ensures predictable builds. To check for missing dependencies, use:

\begin{verbatim}
	python -m pip check
\end{verbatim}

\textit{Output:}

\begin{verbatim}
	No broken requirements found.
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Creating a Python Requirements File After Development}

While it is possible to create it manually, it's good practice to use the \texttt{pipreqs} module. Install it with:

\begin{verbatim}
	pip install pipreqs
\end{verbatim}

Running \texttt{pipreqs} in the command line generates a file \texttt{requirements.txt} automatically:

\begin{verbatim}
	$ pipreqs /home/project/location
	Successfully saved requirements file in /home/project/location/requirements.txt
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Why You Should Use a Python Requirements File}

Create a \texttt{requirements.txt} file when starting a new data science project. It's a best practice, particularly in the context of version control.

Using Python requirements files is among Python development best practices. It significantly reduces the need for managing and supervising different libraries. Managing library dependencies from one place makes it more convenient and faster compared to pasting a list of dependency paths into the command line.

GitHub provides automated vulnerability alerts for dependencies in your repository when you upload a \texttt{requirements.txt} with your code. It checks for conflicts and alerts the administrator if any are detected, and it can even resolve the vulnerabilities automatically.

\subsection{Best Practices for Using a Python Requirements File}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Always use the command \texttt{pip freeze} to generate an up-to-date list of Python modules and packages installed in the virtual environment.
	\item Only list necessary Python modules and packages in \texttt{requirements.txt}.
	\item Save the \texttt{requirements.txt} in the project repository for easy installation by other developers.
	\item Use \texttt{pip install -r requirements.txt} to install all listed Python modules and packages.
	\item Keep \texttt{requirements.txt} up to date for the latest versions of Python modules and packages.
\end{itemize}
